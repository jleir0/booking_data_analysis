We have a data set with booking information. You can download the data set here:

This is what we want to know about the data: 
1. What are the most popular guest origin countries? 
2. What is the room price per night? 
3. How does the previous price vary throughout the year? 
4. What is the distribution of guests per month? 
5. For how long do guests book their stays? 
The solution provide different dimensions, when necessary, to help the business better understand the data. 
Cancellations and accommodation types are important business concepts.
